                            I spent 31 years teaching PE and coaching basketball in California. For the first 15 years, I thought my <span id="pension-name-1">CalSTRS</span> pension 
                            would be enough for retirement. "Teachers have great benefits," everyone said. Then I actually did the math. 
                            Let me show you what nobody told me when I started teaching—and what EVERY educator needs to understand about 
                            the retirement income gap.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        When you started teaching, you probably heard some version of this: <strong>"Don't worry about retirement—you have a pension!"</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        And that's true! <span id="state-name">California</span> teachers are part of <strong id="pension-system">CalSTRS</strong> (<span id="pension-full-name">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span>), 
                        <span id="pension-context">one of the largest and most well-funded pension systems in the United States.</span> It's a <strong>defined-benefit pension</strong>, 
                        meaning you'll receive a guaranteed monthly paycheck for the rest of your life after you retire.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        But here's the part they conveniently leave out: <strong>Your <span id="pension-name-2">CalSTRS</span> pension will only replace about <span id="replacement-range">60-70%</span> of your final salary.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        Think about that for a second. If you're making $100,000 in your final year of teaching, <span id="pension-name-3">CalSTRS</span> will pay you about 
                        <span id="payment-range">$60,000-$70,000</span> per year in retirement. That's a <strong>$30,000-$40,000 annual income drop</strong>.

                        Now here's where it gets scary. You're not retired for just a few years—you could live another <strong>25-30 years</strong> after retiring at 62. 
                        That $30,000 annual gap adds up:

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        And that's NOT accounting for inflation. In reality, the purchasing power gap grows even larger over time. 
                        This is why so many retired teachers struggle financially—not because they were bad with money, but because 
                        nobody explained this gap to them when they were young.

                        Let's be real: Most teachers don't work 40 years. Here's why:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="space-y-2 ml-6 text-gray-700">
                        <li>• <strong>Career changers</strong> who become teachers in their 30s or 40s</li>
                        <li>• <strong>Teachers who retire early</strong> due to burnout, health issues, or family needs</li>
                        <li>• <strong>Life happens</strong>—raising kids, caring for aging parents, relocating for a spouse's job</li>
                        <li>• <strong>Many teachers want OUT by 62</strong>, not continuing to 67 or 70</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        The typical <span id="state-name-2">California</span> teacher retires with <strong>25-30 years of service</strong>, which means a pension 
                        that replaces <strong id="typical-range">50-60%</strong> of their final salary. Even teachers with 35 years only hit <span id="years-35-percent">70%</span>.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Social Security: The Good News for 2025! 🎉</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        Here's something HUGE that just changed: For decades, teachers got screwed on Social Security benefits. 
                        But as of <strong>January 2025</strong>, that penalty was eliminated. Let me explain what this means for you.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="bg-blue-50 border-2 rounded-lg p-5 mb-4" style="border-color: #2E5C8A;">
                        <div class="font-bold text-lg mb-3" style="color: #2E5C8A;">📚 What is the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)?</div>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                            The WEP was a 1983 law that <strong>reduced Social Security benefits</strong> for people who also received a pension 
                            from work where they didn't pay Social Security taxes—like teachers with <span id="pension-name-wep">CalSTRS</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                            Here's why it existed: Social Security's benefit formula is progressive—it replaces a higher percentage of income 
                            for lower earners. But if you worked 10 years in the private sector (paying into Social Security) and 25 years 
                            teaching (paying into <span id="pension-name-wep-2">CalSTRS</span> instead), Social Security would see only your 10 years of reported earnings and think 
                            you were a low-income worker. WEP corrected this by reducing your Social Security benefit.
                        </p>

                            In December 2024, Congress passed the <strong>Social Security Fairness Act</strong>, which repealed WEP 
                            (and its cousin, GPO—Government Pension Offset). Effective <strong>January 2025</strong>, teachers now receive 
                            their <strong>FULL Social Security benefits</strong> based on their work history—no more penalties!

                            To qualify for Social Security benefits, you need at least <strong>40 credits</strong> (roughly 10 years of work 
                            in jobs where you paid Social Security taxes). If you've only taught and never worked other jobs, you won't receive 
                            Social Security—but you also weren't affected by WEP. Your <span id="pension-name-wep-4">CalSTRS</span> pension is your primary retirement income.

                        <strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you worked non-teaching jobs before or during your teaching career, the WEP repeal 
                        could add <strong>$300-800/month</strong> to your retirement income. That's $3,600-$9,600 per year—real money that
